The Gaming Room client software requirements were to create a web-based version of the game "Draw It or Lose It". There was an android app version and the client wished to expand its reach to multiple platforms. The objective was to create a web-based game that allows multiple teams with multiple players to participate. The key requirements include support for multiple teams and players, unique game and team names, and ensuring only one game instance exists at any given time. 

Working through a design document is beneficial for code development as it provides a clear roadmap with well-defined requirements and architectural insights. It aids in efficient collaboration and communication, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and scope creep. Additionally, it serves as a valuable reference point for testing, code reviews, and future maintenance, promoting code quality and reusability.
